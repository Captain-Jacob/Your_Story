Diarly

Well, well, well adding a README might not be worth it… yet here we are.

This is a simple diary app — nothing too fancy, really.
If I don’t forget, I’ll upload the .exe file… maybe.

Oh, and I forgot to change some language settings,
so right now it best works in Turkish.
Still, better than nothing, I guess.

I don’t plan to update this project,
but I’ll gladly accept any modification requests —
whether it’s for help or just for fun.
